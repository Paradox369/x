We will discuss now. But first assignment is take the markup shared. Above.
And break it into Liveview components
1) create a new app called x  --done.
2) paste the markup in home so it appears  --done.
3) create liveview components to each part of the markup. <Navbar> <List> <Detail>
Looking at example in CoreComponents and following the tutorials in pragmaticsydio

After that is a success upload a photo using the tutorial in pragmatic studio fir uploads
This will introduce you to the basic concepts and then in 2 weeks we can build the app together

My proposal is: 2 months to see if you pick it up. Them after the 2 months 150euros per month for 2.5 days a week 
for 6 months. If all works and you have learned and you like it we can discuss fulltime.
We will work together so you will get mentoring and a real project. So is not just the money is the opportunity to 
work in a real project.





to run the app:
- from iex terminal:        iex.bat -S mix phx.server
- from powershell:          mix phx.server
- from application script:  mix run_app
